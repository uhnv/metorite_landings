    <h2>Meteorite Data Representation</h2>
    <p> The goal of this project is to demonstrate the ability to:
    <ul>
        <li>Consume data programmatically from a given resource</li>
        <li>Understand the data presented</li>
        <li>Organize/disseminate/communicate the data in a presentable format</li>
        <li>Utilize a GitHub source code repository</li>
    </ul>
    The data is taken from NASA <a href="https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/meteorite-landings" target="_blank">meteorite
        landings "Downloads & Resources"</a> page.
    </p>
    <p>In addition to requirements this web page is made using <a href="https://brand.wsu.edu/colors"
            target="_blank">WSU
            Colors Guidance</a>.

        <h2>Consuming and Analyzing Data</h2>
        <p>
            Data analyzing was done in two parts of the project.
            In the navigation bar you can go to "Map visualization" or "Chart representation" to see different ways to
            consume provided data.
        </p>

        <p>
            The "Map visualization" page is the representation of the data from JSON file.
            This is an interactive map with meteorite landings actross the World.
            To create this meteorite landings map I have used <a href="https://leafletjs.com" target="_blank">LeafletJS
            </a> open source interactive map liblrary.
            Each marker on the map represents a meteorite landing indicating it's actual position on the map.
            The variety of the library functionality was used, you can click on the marker and see the pop-up label with
            additional information for particular meteorite.
            All data as the marker position and pop-up label is taken from the provided JSON file.
        </p>

        <p>
            For the second part of the project the data from the provided CSV file was used.
            "Chart representation" page provides several different charts that are.....

            <h2>Problems and Observations</h2>
            <p><b>I.</b> After the initial setup was done I realized that not all entries were displayed on the map.<br>
            This might be caused by two issuess:
            <ul>
                <li>1. Leaflet has limitations on rendering large number of the objects (markers) on the map.</li>
                <li>2. Additionally, not all the entries have valid longitude and latitude. 
                    (See the image below. The higlited stuff is the entry with no geolocation.)
                    Thus, the code execution stops on the first invalid entry throwing the error in the browser
                    console.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <div class="image">
                <img src="nullGeo.JPG">
            </div>
            <p><b>Solutions:</b> Filter out the invalid values, and handle the errors, so the execution will not be interrupted.<br>
            The limitation issue was solved using the cirkles instead of markers, here is the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43015854/large-dataset-of-markers-or-dots-in-leaflet" target ="_blank">solution</a> idea.
            It seems that cirkles worked out, but performanse feels not the best, but still usable. All entries are processed (see the console output on the image below.)
            Another way to solve this issue, and make performace better might be a plugin for LeafletJS library (not tested yet), or use another library instead of LeafletJS.
