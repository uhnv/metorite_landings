    <h2>Meteorite Data Representation</h2>
    <p> The goal of this project is to demonstrate the ability to:
    <ul>
        <li>Consume data programmatically from a given resource</li>
        <li>Understand the data presented</li>
        <li>Organize/disseminate/communicate the data in a presentable format</li>
        <li>Utilize a GitHub source code repository</li>
    </ul>
    The data is taken from NASA <a href="https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/meteorite-landings" target="_blank">meteorite
        landings "Downloads & Resources"</a> page.
    </p>
    <p>In addition to requirements this project is made using <a href="https://brand.wsu.edu/colors"
            target="_blank">WSU
            Colors Guidance</a>.

        <h2>Consuming and Analyzing Data</h2>
        <p>
            Data visualization and analysis were done in two parts of the project.
            In the navigation bar, the user can go to "Map visualization" or "Chart representation" to see different ways to consume the provided data.
        </p>

        <p>
            The "Map visualization" page is a representation of the data from JSON file.
            This is an interactive map with meteorite landings across the World.
            To create this meteorite landings map I have used <a href="https://leafletjs.com" target="_blank">LeafletJS
            </a> open source interactive map library.
            Each circle on the map represents a meteorite landing indicating its actual position on the map.
            Some of the library functionality was used, you can click on the marker and see the pop-up label with
            additional information for a particular meteorite.
        </p>

        <p>
            The <a href="scvToChart.html">Chart representation</a> page has a pie chart and a bar chart.
            The pie chart represents a proportion of the different types of meteorites found on the Earth.
            The bar chart is a graphical representation of the size categories of the meteorites found on the Earth.
        </p>


        <div>
            <h2>Problems</h2>

            <p>After the initial setup was done it was clear that not all entries were displayed on the map.<br>
                This might be caused by two issues:
            <ul>
                <li>Leaflet might have limitations on rendering a large number of the objects (markers) on the map.</li>
                <li>Additionally, not all the entries have valid longitude and latitude.
                    (See the image below. The highlighted area is the entry with no geolocation.)
                    Thus, the code execution stops on the first invalid entry throwing the error in the browser
                    console.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <div class="image">
                <img src="nullGeo.JPG">
            </div>
            <p><b>Solutions:</b><br>
            <ul>
                <li>Filter out the invalid values, and handle the errors, so the execution will not be interrupted.</li>
                <li>The limitation issue was solved using the circles instead of markers, here is the 
                    <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43015854/large-dataset-of-markers-or-dots-in-leaflet"
                        target="_blank">solution</a> idea.
            </ul>
            It seems that circles worked better than markers, and all entries are processed (see the console output on the image below).
            Another possible way to solve this issue, and, probably, make performance better might be a plugin for LeafletJS library
            (not tested yet), or using another library.

            <h2>Observations</h2>
            <p>
                The provided data is not consistent.
                The issue with rendering all entries from the JSON might not be present if geolocation were present for all entries.
